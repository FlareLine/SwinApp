# SwinApp 

:notebook:

The Github Repository for Swinburne University of Technology's new, improved and dead mobile application.

## How to Build

For working with SwinApp we recommend the usage of any flavour of [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (Windows or Mac)..]

Note that for Xamarin.Forms development it is required that the user installs the *"Cross Platform Mobile Development with .NET"* Package
as it will include all dependencies for working with Android and iOS.
