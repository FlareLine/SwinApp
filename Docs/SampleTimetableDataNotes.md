# Timetable Data Notes

## Tags/Elements

- `<tt:timetable>` (Root Tag)
    - The root of the timetable payload
    - Doesn't include anything notable
- `<allocation>` (Main Element)
    - Allocations are the `lessons`/`sessions` that you have in your timetable
    - They have no attributes, are explicitly an entity for other data
- `<subject>`
    - At most will contain 2 children
        - `<code>`: the Subject code
        - `<description>`: the Subject description
- `<campus />`
    - Self closing, has a single attribute of the campus code (`<code>`)
        - Will probably need to enumerate this value
- `<activityType>`
    - The type of allocation, the value enclosed in the tags
    - This will need to be enumerated
- `<activityCode>`
    - The code for the activity
    - Not sure what they mean
- `<staff />`
    - In the example, this was blank and self closing
- `<schedule>`
    - Very weirdly structured, basically has the following notable tags
    - `<startDate>` and `<endDate>`
        - Both date values, contained within the tags
    - `<startTime>`
        - 24 hour starting time for the allocation, contained within the tags
    - `<duration>`
        - An integer value of the allocation's length in minutes
    - `<daysOfWeek>`
        - A collection of `<weekDay>` elements, these elements having two attributes
            - `day` (the name of the day)
            - `hasSchedule` (a boolean value dictating whether it has a schedule)
    - `<room />`
        - The room code of the allocation is kept in this self closing tag under the attribute `code`
    - `<excludedDates>`
        - A collection of `<exDate>` tags, containing `start` and `end` attributes
